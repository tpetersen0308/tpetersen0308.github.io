I'm finding that one of my favorite parts of coding so far is helping other students out when they get hung up on something. It's almost like debugging x10. When debugging one of my own programs, I have strategies to employ in my efforts to figure out why my program is crashing. When helping someone else debug, I have to come up with more strategies to figure out what it is they don't understand about why their program is crashing, in addition to understanding for myself why their program is crashing. 

It can often be harder to suss out the bugs in someone else's code than my own; after all, I should be intimately familiar with code that I wrote from scratch and thus more attuned to its potential flaws. This is especially the case when someone is really lost. For instance, if someone is unsure of how to interpret an error message then they may have no idea which part of their code needs debugging and thus it becomes an additional task to guide them to the parts they need to share with me so I can help them out. I can start by reading the error and then helping them retrace their steps, which makes the process an exercise in communication and patience as well. 

It's also not enough to simply help someone get their code working. One of the hardest parts of this is helping someone understand why it wasn't working in the first place. I find that this tends to require a deeper understanding of the programming principles at hand than if I were simply debugging my own work, in which case I don't need to be able to explicate every concept at play so precisely and in a way that is salient to the person listening. 

I realize now that I started this post by stating how much I enjoy helping people out when they're stuck, and then proceeded to just describe how it's more difficult than debugging my own code. The reason I like it so much is that it's rewarding. It feels good to engage with another student and feel like I helped and encouraged someone. It gives me some perspective that's invaluable when I'm pulling my hair out. I get to walk away feeling more confident and having deepened my own understanding. Plus, I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a little ego trip out of testing and proving my own understanding to others in the process.
